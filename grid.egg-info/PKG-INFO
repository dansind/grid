        Grid
        ===========
        
        Grid contains objects and functions pertaining to 3D volumetric (grid) data.
        It was specifically written for 3D-RISM distribution data but is
        by no means limited to such data. 
        Grid requires numpy.
        
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            import grid
        
            mygrid = grid.dx2Grid("mydxfilename")
